##  Research Experience

### Gene Expression Data Analysis Using Mixed Effects Models (Aug 2024 – Present)
- Applied mixed-effects models to analyze large-scale gene expression data (1,176 genes, two conditions).  
- Processed microarray data and validated findings using permutation tests and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.  
- Categorized functionally related genes based on similarity of expression profiles.  

### Gene Expression Profiling Based on High-Throughput Sequencing Technology (Aug 2024 – Present)
- Used high-throughput sequencing to compare PBMC expression profiles between tuberculosis patients and controls.  
- Conducted RNA extraction, cDNA library preparation, bridge PCR amplification, and Illumina deep sequencing.  
- Identified diagnostic marker genes through differential expression analysis.  

### Undergraduate Thesis: The Impact of Gravity Axis on Mouse Place Cells (Sep 2023 – Apr 2024)  
*Supervised by Prof. Chun Xu, Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences*  
- Recorded hippocampal place cell activity under varying slopes using GRIN Lens calcium imaging.  
- Processed imaging data with CNMF-E and tracked behavior using DeepLabCut.  
- Analyzed discharge data and behavioral correlation to reveal the effect of gravity on spatial coding.

### Brain Electrical Activity Acquisition & Decoding Algorithms for BMIs (Jul 2023 – Nov 2023)  
*Published in Highlights in Science, Engineering and Technology, Vol. 74, 2023*  
- Studied BMI decoding for prosthetic control among amputees and paralytics.  
- Compared invasive vs. noninvasive signal acquisition and examined linear/nonlinear decoding algorithms.  

### Path Academy Online Research Project (Jul 2023 – Nov 2023)  
*Supervised by Prof. Joni Wallis, UC Berkeley*
